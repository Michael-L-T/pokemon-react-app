# About this project

This project was created by Michael Livermore-Tozer for the 3sidedcube developer test found here: 
https://github.com/3sidedcube/web-developer-test
The repo for this project can be found found on github here:
https://github.com/Michael-L-T/pokemon-react-app/

This is a project to build a web UI that will allow users to easily view pokemon data taken from the 
pokemon API (https://pokeapi.co/) and presently allows users to view and filter pokemon by generation
and type in a grid and to see additional information on individual pokemon

## Getting started

This project was created using React and bootstrapped using Create React App
It can be run locally in development mode using `npm start` then viewed in a browser at http://localhost:3000
Full details are in the create_react_app.md README

The list of dependencies can be found in the package.json file
In addition to the default dependencies this project uses Bootstrap and React-Router-Dom

# FAQs
## If you used any particular libraries why did you choose them?

For styling with css I used the bootstrap library/framework as its what I'm most familiar with and also its
very widely so other developers are likely to to understand it as well

For routing with react I used React Router Dom as this was the most frequently recommended

## Did you have any challenges and if so, how did you overcome them?

None of the logic involved in this project was particularly complex or challenging however I did have some
issues with at the start due to not being overly familiar with React's syntax and structure however I was
able to overcome this by referring to a previous tutorial project I had done as well as by referring to
videos on youtube by people who had some similar projects working with the pokemon API

## Did you add any extra features?

The only additional feature beyond those mentioned in the user stories was the ability to filter by pokemon type

## If you had more time, what else would you implement?

There are lots of additional features that could be added to this but in particular those mentioned in the 
User Stories i.e. the the ability to compare pokemon and some way for users to save pokemon, also some arrows
or prev/next buttons to allow users to navigate between pages more easily as the current pagination is awkward
and there is no way to move between pokemon on their individual pages

Other features would include search functionality and possibly the ability to combine multiple filters although
this would might slow the loading speed too much

Also the project lacks unit tests which would be the next thing to implement.
